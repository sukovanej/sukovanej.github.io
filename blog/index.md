## About me &#128556; 

Hi there, I'm Milan Suk, a software engineer at [kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/) from the Czech Republic, currently living in Spain. Nowadays, I use Typescript with [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) mainly but I have professional experience with other languages and their ecosystems like Python or C++. I do backend stuff but I have experience delivering web frontends as well. I'm interested in functional programming (notably Haskell) and techniques that help delivering high quality, maintainable and extendible software. Feel free to check my [Github](https://github.com/sukovanej) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-suk/).

*Funny fact: this whole site is created using [my own generator written in Python](https://github.com/sukovanej/sukovanej.github.io/tree/main/blog-generator) from obsidian markdown files.*
