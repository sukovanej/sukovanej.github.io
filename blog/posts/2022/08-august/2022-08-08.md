title: Custom `Link` extension for `marko` markdown Python library
---

I generate this site using a simple Python script (currently 108 LOC) from markdown files created using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I use [python-frontmatter](https://github.com/eyeseast/python-frontmatter) Python library to parse the markdown with yaml header and then [marko](https://github.com/frostming/marko) (there is a javascript implementation with the same name) to parse the markdown and generate the HTML.

In obsidian, I link the files using the usual markdown syntax and during the HTML generation I need to convert these links to HTML hyperlinks. That works out-of-box in marko but links contain addresses to markdown files (without the `.md` extension) and I need append there the `.html` extension.

## Marko extensions

Marko allows to extend its behaviour using extensions. Extensions can be provided in the constructor of the `Markdown` class. Let's call our extension `LinkExtension`.

```python
class LinkExtension:
    """TODO"""

markdown = Markdown(extensions=[LinkExtension])
```

The extension can specify list of `Element` classes that implement element parsing. Luckily, we're not introducing a new syntax and there is already existing `marko.inline.Link` class for that. 

```python
from marko.inline import Link

class LinkExtension:
    elements = [Link]
```

Actually, we can completely ignore it and not specify it at all because the only thing we're going to modify is the rendering. We implement a render mixin class. We need to implement `render_link` method which is going to be used instead of the one from `marko.html_renderer.HTMLRenderer`. It accepts a single `element` object that contains `title` and `dest` properties parsed using the `Link` parser.

I simply called the parent's `render_link` with an element modified so that the `dest` has `.html` extension. I decided to make a shallow copy of the `element` object, but it works correctly also when the element is mutated. But mutation is dangerous in general, so just in case...

```python
from copy import copy

class LinkRendererMixin:
    def render_link(self, element):
        new_element = copy(element)
        new_element.dest = f"{new_element.dest}.html"
        return super().render_link(element)

```

The final extension is then a simple class specifying the renderer.

```python
class LinkExtension:
    renderer_mixins = [LinkRendererMixin]
```

## Final result

```python
from copy import copy

from marko import Markdown

class LinkRendererMixin:
    def render_link(self, element):
        new_element = copy(element)
        new_element.dest = f"{new_element.dest}.html"
        return super().render_link(new_element)

class LinkExtension:
    renderer_mixins = [LinkRendererMixin]

def main():
    markdown = Markdown(extensions=[LinkExtension])
    example_text = "Hello world with [link](files/another_one)"
    print(markdown.convert(example_text))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

which output is

```html
<p>Hello world with <a href="files/another_one.html">link</a>.</p>
```
